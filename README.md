In week 2 assignments, I was able to answer the questions prompted by Michael Cassens. I was also able to set up my homework repositories. Some of the challenges are based around the instructions and comprehending the objectives of the assignments. I believe I successfully submitted my assignment correctly but I'm also crossing my fingers that I did.
