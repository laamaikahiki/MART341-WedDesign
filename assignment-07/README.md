I've come across many forms while browsing the web. One in particular is contact form. Usually you would put your contact information and there's a box where you can add a comment or question. The purpose is for the business/company to contact you in relation to your question or comment.
Here are some examples of text, selection, and button input, and their usage:
Text: text box
Selection: Ask the end-users to select an option from the options listed
Button Input: Buttons are common interactive elements in web design, and provide graphic interest as well as functionality to your links and fields. 
I'm trying to catch up with the rest of the class considering that I'm behind on my assignments. Some of the things that I appreciate are the website that we can refer to when writing our code. Michael also post examples that we can refer to.
