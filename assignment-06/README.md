Based on my research, I believe that a main document can only have one <head> and one <body> elements. The <head> element is a container for processing information and document metadata. The <head> contains high-level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. In this sense, we can consider the <head> to contain the thoughts of the page. The body element is where all of the “meat & potatoes” (if you will) of the site gets placed. This is the data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the client's local computer.

Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. Structure includes elements such as:

    Headings
    Paragraphs
    Breaks
    Lists

These elements will help guide a user visually and provide information about the type of content through a document. These elements are also used by the browser and the DOM to understand the content of the document. A browser uses this structural markup to assist screen readers and other accessibility-based software.

Semantic markup us used to reinforce the semantics - or meaning - of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place emphasis on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being strong. They can also provide citations or "quotations", link to definitions, or distinguish editorial changes.

This assignment is really late due to the fact that I had two issues that I faced over the last couple of weeks. First, I sprained my ankle while participating in a practice volleyball session to gear up for intramural games at Campus Recreation. I didn't even make it to the first official game due to my injury. I was also on crutches and gradually transitioned to a one-knew scooter. Another issue that I've been dealing with is a death of a family member due to COVID-19. I got the call that she was in the hospital and I honestly thought that she was going to pull through this ordeal, however, the sad news came from a phone call from Hawaiʻi that my family member has transitioned on to the after world.
