        Easy Hawaiian Puaʻa Kālua (Pulled Pork)
    </h1>

    <h1>
        Ingredients
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4-5 pounds of pork shoulder or pork butt roast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Hickory liquid smoke</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Hawaiian sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
        Directions
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the pork and then pat dry. Cut into 4 chunks, pierce with a fork, then place in the instant pot.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup water in the instant pot or slow cooker. Pour liquid smoke over the top and then sprinkle salt on top. Place lid on top and set to high pressure. Cook for 60 minutes and then do a natural slow release for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pork and shred with 2 forks. Remove any excess fat. Place back in the pot and let sit in the juices for 15 minutes, or until ready to serve. Serve over rice, in tortillas, on a slider or in a salad.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pumpkin Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl beat eggs and sugar together.</li>
        <li>Add cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and vanilla and mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Add pumpkin and mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in evaporated milk and mix until fully combined. Dairy-free use 1 cup of canned coconut milk (full
            fat).</li>
        <li>Spay 9-inch pie dish with gluten-free cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Press the dough into the pie dish.</li>
        <li>Using the middle rack, bake for 5 minutes at 425° F.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and pour pumpkin pie filling into the pie crust. Depending on how deep your pie pan is, you
            may have a little of the filling left over. I always pour it into a custard cup and bake it.</li>
        <li>Using the middle rack bake for 15 minutes at 425° F and then lower the heat to 350° F and bake for an
            additional 40 to 50 minutes. Please watch your pie and if the crust is getting too brown for your liking
            cover crust edges with foil.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool before serving. I like to allow the pie to cool for at least 1 hour before I refrigerate the
            pie. It's best served cold.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or cold with whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Once cooled cover and refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
