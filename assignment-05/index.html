    <h1>
        The Three Little Pigs
    </h1>
    <h2>James Halliwell-Phillipps</h2>

        Once upon a time, there were three little pigs and the time came for them to seek their fortunes to build their houses.
        The first little pig built him a house made of straw. The middle brother decided to build his house of sticks. Due to the
        first two houses not being strong, the third pig - the oldest brother decided to build his house of brick. He wanted a
        strong house because he heard of the wolf nearby that liked to catch little pigs and eat them. When the three little houses
        were completed, the all celebrated and cheered with joy while screaming, "Who's scared of furious wolf, furious wolf,
        furious wolf? Who's scared of furious wolf?" After their joyful screams, they all headed back to their newly built houses.

        Just as the first pig got to his house, he was startled by the big bad wolf. He squealed and screamed as he quickly slammed
        his door. Wit a furious voice, the big bad wolf cried, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in." "Not by the hair of my
        chinny-chin-chin," said the little pig. "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf. The wolf
        blew as hard as he could and down came the house. The little pig ran as quick as he cold to his brothers house made of
        sticks.

        The wolf was furious as he approached the middle brothers house that was made of stick. The little pig and his brother
        were singing, "Who's scared of furious wolf, furious wolf, furious wolf? Who's scared of furious wolf?" The furious wolf
        roared as he opened the door and said, "Let me come in." "No we won't," said the pigs. "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and
        I'll blow your house in," said the wolf. A strong blow from the wolf and there went the middle brothers house. Both pigs
        ran as fast as they could to their older brothers house that was made of bricks.

        Now that all three pigs were together, they started to sing, "Who's scared of furious wolf, furious wolf, furious wolf?
        Who's scared of furious wolf?" This made the big wolf furious. He said, "Open the door little pigs. Let me come in!" "No
        we won ªt," said the pigs. "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf. After blowing with
        all is might, he noticed that he couldn't blow the brick house down. He decided to enter through the chimney so he
        climbed up to the roof and jumped down the chimney. He ended up jumping into a boiling pot of hot water. He screamed
        and climbed up the chimeny as fast as he could and ran far into the woods. The three little pigs cheered of joy and
        never saw the big bad wolf again. They enjoyed living in the brick house. They kept singing, "Who's scared of furious
        wolf, furious wolf, furious wolf? Who's scared of furious wolf?" And they lived happily ever after. The end.
